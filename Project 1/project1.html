                            <br>

                            <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                                Back in 2010, in the heart of Brooklyn, New York, three friends—Marco, Lena, and Tony—shared a bold idea: to create a pizza experience that combined tradition, creativity, and a touch of fun. That vision gave birth to a cozy little pizzeria built on a single delicious secret—our now-famous handmade dough, affectionately named “Dough Re Mi.”
                                Crafted from a family recipe passed down for generations, Dough Re Mi became the heart and soul of every pizza we made. With its perfect balance of chew and crisp, it quickly won the hearts (and tastebuds) of the neighborhood. What began as a one-oven kitchen with a handful of regulars grew into a community favorite. By 2015, our little pizza place had expanded, but we never forgot our roots—or our commitment to fresh, flavorful ingredients.
                                Today, Dough Re Mi Pizza continues to bake every pie with the same care and passion that started it all. Because to us, pizza isn’t just food—it’s music you can taste
